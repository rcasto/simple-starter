# Simple Starter Project Template
A project template powered by [rollupjs](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en), [babel](https://babeljs.io), [sass](https://sass-lang.com), [express](https://expressjs.com), and more.

Framework agnostic so build with what you love!

## Getting Started
To get the simple example project started do the following:
1. First build the project by running the command `npm run build`
2. Start up the server by running the command `npm start`
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser

You should be up and running now!

### Development
To ease development there are separate commands that can be used to watch files for changes and update the application without the need to restart the server.
 
You can make this happen by running the command `npm run dev`
Hack away, and reload the page to see your changes.
